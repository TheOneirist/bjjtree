"""Idea here is to allow a user to make their own roadmap. Create a tree with positions as the nodes and transitions as the edges. I want a video section for nodes and edges as well as comments. I want it personizable. e.g. I personally do 1/2 and butterfly half and here are my transitions and have some base sample library (here are some good references for butterfly half, for example)"""
